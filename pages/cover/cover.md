# The Key
Learning how to learn new things

* It's okay if nothing on the previous slide made any sense to you
* We're going to get through this all together
* The most important thing is that you learn how to learn new things

<!-- 

Slide Notes: 

* The only thing that's constant is change in this industry
* Frameworks and tools that were popular 5 years ago are long gone
* And new frameworks and tooling are coming up like weeds 
* You have to be comfortable with change and with learning new things all the time in this industry
